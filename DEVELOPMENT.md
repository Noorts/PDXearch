## Prerequisites

- Clang (LLVM Clang 18)
- CMake (>= 3.12)
- vcpkg
- A BLAS implementation
- OpenMP

Once you have these you can [build the extension](#build).

### Install Clang

```sh
brew install llvm@18
```

> [!NOTE]
> When building the extension (discussed below), explicitly pass the LLVM 18
> compiler binaries to make sure LLVM@18 is used. For example:
> `CC=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang CXX=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang++ make`.

### Install CMake

Versions >= 3.12 are supported.

```sh
brew install cmake
```

Or instead build and install from the [source](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake).

### Install vcpkg

Install vcpkg prerequisite: pkg-config.

```sh
brew install pkg-config
```

Install vcpkg using the instructions below, or check out the [extension template's instructions for vcpkg](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template?tab=readme-ov-file#managing-dependencies).

Change to a directory where you want vcpkg to be installed.

```sh
cd ~
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

Optionally check out the version we've used.

```sh
git checkout 4334d8b4c8
```

```sh
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
```

```sh
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Install BLAS

On Apple Silicon (M1-M5) we rely on the Apple Accelerate framework. This means there is nothing to install.

### Install OpenMP

```sh
brew install libomp
```

Note: You might have to set `OpenMP_ROOT` in your `.zshrc` file.

```sh
export OpenMP_ROOT=$(brew --prefix)/opt/libomp
```

## Build

### Building the Extension

1. Clone the repo and ensure the submodules are also cloned:

    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Noorts/PDXearch.git
    ```

2. Build the extension (the default is an optimized `release` build):

    ```sh
    cd PDXearch
    ```

    ```sh
    make
    ```

    Other build modes include `debug` and `reldebug`. Include `DISABLE_SANITIZER=1` to avoid errors raised by the DuckDB core itself.

    ```sh
    DISABLE_SANITIZER=1 make debug
    ```

3. [Recommended] For faster builds, install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/), and then set the generator when you build:

    ```sh
    brew install ccache ninja
    ```

    ```sh
    GEN=ninja make
    ```

@Noorts personally uses

```sh
GEN=ninja DISABLE_SANITIZER=1 CC=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang CXX=$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang++ EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1" make
```

The built extension artifact can be found at `PDXearch/build/release/extension/pdxearch/pdxearch.duckdb_extension`.

For PDXearch extension usage, please see to the [README.md](README.md).

### PDXearch Variants

The extension's internals have been implemented in two variants. These variants
both implement index creation, non-filtered search, and filtered search.

**1. Row group**: The first variant creates a separate internal IVF index for each
row group. This allows the extension to parallelize across row groups, which
speeds up both the creation of the index and using it for search.

**2. Global**: The second variant uses a single internal IVF index for all
embeddings in the targeted table column.

From the user's perspective the creation of an index (`CREATE INDEX`) and using
it for search is the same. The user always interacts with a single database
index.

You decide which variant to use at compile time. Row group is the default. Build
the extension with the following argument to use the global variant:

```sh
EXT_FLAGS="-DPDX_USE_ALTERNATIVE_GLOBAL_VERSION=1" make
```

### Clangd Language Server Support

For
[clangd](https://open-vsx.org/extension/llvm-vs-code-extensions/vscode-clangd)
support in VSCode-based editors, ensure you build the compilation database.

Include the following argument in your build command (each time you build):

```sh
EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1" make
```

Then in the PDXearch root directory, symlink the generated compilation database (once).

```sh
ln -s ./build/release/compile_commands.json ./
```

You might have to manually set the clangd executable path in the VSCode clangd extension configuration.

## Clean, Format, Tidy-Check

```sh
make clean
```

```sh
make format
```

Portable `make format` alternative:

```sh
uv run --with black --with clang_format==11.0.1 --with cmake-format duckdb/scripts/format.py --all --fix --noconfirm --directories src test
```

```sh
make tidy-check
```

Tidy-check alternative that explicitly uses LLVM 18:

```sh
make tidy-check TIDY_BINARY=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang-tidy
```

## Test

After building the extension you can run the tests. See
[test/README.md](test/README.md) for more details.

```sh
make test
```

```sh
make test_debug
```

Run one specific test:

```sh
./build/release/"/test/unittest" "test/sql/search/index_scan_uncommon_dimensions.test"
```

## FAQ

- Q: I pulled the latest commits and now I run into compiler errors when I build the extension.
  - A: Did the latest commits include the bump of a submodule? (e.g., DuckDB was updated) If this is the case, then when you run `git status` it will state `"modified: duckdb (new commits)"`. In the root PDXearch directory, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure your local submodules match the committed versions.
